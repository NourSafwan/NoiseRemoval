# Audio Noise Reduction using DSP

This project implements an audio noise reduction tool using **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** techniques, specifically a **Low-Pass Butterworth Filter**. The app filters out high-frequency noise from an input audio file, producing a cleaner output audio.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Reduces high-frequency noise using a **Butterworth Low-Pass Filter**.
- Supports **.wav** audio files.
- Saves the filtered audio to a new file.
- Provides waveform visualizations for both the original and filtered audio.
